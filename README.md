# EstiSketch

EstiSketch is a fun, intuitive application designed for contractors and designers to quickly sketch building plans, place windows and doors, manage materials, and estimate job costs. With an easy-to-use interface and powerful drawing and snapping tools, EstiSketch streamlines the design process from concept to cost estimation.

## Current Features

### Drawing Tools
- **Wall Drawing:**  
  Draw continuous walls using a dedicated tool. Walls are drawn continuously until you press the `Esc` key. Double-clicking inside a room automatically completes the wall perimeter.
- **Room Creation:**  
  Define room outlines by continuously placing points. When a closed loop of walls is detected, the room is automatically generated.
- **Dimension Lines:**  
  Place dimension lines by clicking to define start and end points. Dimension lines automatically update and display live measurements (length and angle) as you draw.
- **Doors & Windows:**  
  Add doors and windows that snap to the centers of walls and align with their orientations.
- **Text Annotations:**  
  Place and edit text directly on your plans for additional labeling and information.

### Editing & Navigation
- **Selection and Manipulation:**  
  Use the pointer tool to select and move objects, and the pan tool to navigate around your drawing.
- **Zoom Controls:**  
  Easily zoom in, zoom out, and reset the zoom level to adjust your view.
- **Object Editing:**  
  Modify wall lengths by dragging endpoints, adjust room shapes by moving vertices, and use context menus (right-click) to split, join, or reverse wall directions.
- **Undo/Redo Support:**  
  Quickly correct mistakes with undo and redo functionalities.

### Snapping & Alignment
- **Precise Snapping:**  
  Walls and other elements snap to key points like endpoints, midpoints, grid intersections, and predefined angles (vertical, horizontal, 45°, 22.5°, etc.).
- **Live Measurement Labels:**  
  As you draw, live-updating labels display the wall’s length and angle. These labels remain parallel to the wall and automatically flip to stay right side up based on the wall’s orientation.
- **Drawing Hints:**  
  Faint dashed lines appear to indicate alignment with existing walls, room edges, or grid lines, making it easier to achieve precise layouts.

### Materials & Estimation
- **Manage Materials:**  
  Add, edit, and delete building materials along with details such as name, type, dimensions, and price.
- **Material List View:**  
  View materials organized into categories (e.g., Walls, Floors, Foundation, Roof, Windows, Doors, etc.).
- **Cost Estimation:**  
  Estimate project costs with placeholders for material cost breakdowns, construction phase costs, labor cost estimates, and total cost (more detailed cost estimation features are coming soon).

### File Operations & Settings
- **File Management:**  
  Save projects, open existing plans, and export your designs as PDF files.
- **Customizable Settings:**  
  Adjust default wall dimensions, room dimensions, grid spacing, snapping thresholds, font settings, rulers, construction type, and more through a user-friendly settings dialog.
- **User Interface:**  
  A modern toolbar provides quick access to all tools, along with keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.
- **Help Dialog:**  
  Access integrated help for guidance on using the application.

## Future Enhancements

Based on our application plan, upcoming features include:
- **Enhanced Cost Estimation:**  
  Detailed breakdowns of material costs by category and construction phase, along with refined labor cost calculations.
- **Improved Materials Estimation:**  
  More robust tools for estimating the total amount of materials needed.
- **Curved Walls:**  
  The ability to draw curved walls for more complex building designs.
- **Additional Construction Styles:**  
  Support for more construction methods and material types.
- **Advanced Editing Tools:**  
  Enhanced multi-select, object transformations, and additional context menu options.
- **Expanded Export Options:**  
  More customization options for exporting plans as PDFs or other formats.
- **Integration:**  
  Potential integration with other design and estimation software for a more streamlined workflow.
